# This is my first web3 project whose goal is to develop a nft marketplace, a simplified version of **OpenSea or **Magic Eden.

## The project will be developed on the Internet Computer blockchain network, using the Motoko programming language.

It will be possible to :
- connect to the marketplace using Internet Identity
- to mint your own nfts
- to sell nfts
- to buy nfts

I will create a crytpo __token (HuKou--HK)__ that will be used to trade nfts.
Each wallet will be able to claim 10,000 HK to be able to trade on the marketplace.
