# This is my first web3 project whose goal is to develop a nft marketplace, a simplified version of OpenSea or Magic Eden.

#### The project will be developed on the Internet Computer blockchain network, using the Motoko programming language.

---
It will be possible to :
- connect to the marketplace using Internet Identity
- to mint your own nfts
- to sell nfts
- to buy nfts
- to see the sales price history of each nft on the marketplace


I will create a crytpo __token (HuKou--HK)__ that will be used to trade nfts.
Each wallet will be able to claim 10,000 HK to be able to trade on the marketplace.
