# This is my first web3 project whose goal is to develop a nft marketplace, a simplified version of OpenSea or Magic Eden.

#### The project will be developed on the Internet Computer blockchain network, using the Motoko programming language.

---
It will be possible to :
- connect to the marketplace using Internet Identity
- to mint your own nfts
- to sell nfts
- to buy nfts
- to see the sales price history of each nft on the marketplace


I will create a crytpo __token (HuKou--HK)__ that will be used to trade nfts.
Each wallet will be able to claim 10,000 HK to be able to trade on the marketplace.

My progress on the projet :

The project is completed, all the features are working.
I am doing some tests to make corrections in the code if necessary. 
The project will be deployed to the ICP Live Blockchain (I'll need to buy Cycles for that, so not sure...) or I will make a demo video.

Technologies used for this project :
- React.js 
- Motoko language : to develop my decentralized application on the internet computer blockchain
- Html, CSS
