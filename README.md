# This is my first web3 project 
### In this project I developed a nft marketplace, a simplified version of OpenSea or Magic Eden.

---
Technologies used for this project :

- React.js 
- Motoko language : to build my Dapp on the Internet Computer blockchain network
- Html, CSS
- Vs Code as editor

---
Features :

- Connect to the marketplace using Internet Identity
- Mint your own nfts
- Sell nfts
- Buy nfts
- See the sales price history of each nft on the marketplace


I created a crytpo __token (HuKou--HK)__ used to trade on the marketplace.
Each wallet can claim 10,000 HK (once only).

Project completed :
 
The project will not be deployed to the ICP Live Blockchain as I need to buy Cycles for that.
